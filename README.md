# Mental-health-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms 

**Overview**

This project aims to provide an initial assessment of depression risk through an easy-to-use online application. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the severity of depression based on user-provided questionnaire responses.

# Technologies Used

**Backend**: Python (Machine Learning Algorithms)

**Web Framework**: Flask (Deployment)

**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (User Interface)

**Machine Learning**: Decision Trees, Random Forests

# Features

**User-Friendly Interface**: Accessible via any internet-connected device.

**Comprehensive Questionnaire**: Covers physical and mental health aspects relevant to depression.

**Depression Classification**: Utilizes Random Forest Algorithm to classify users into five categories: Not Depressed, Mildly Depressed, Moderately Depressed, Severely Depressed, and Critically Depressed.

**Recommendations**: Encourages seeking professional help for diagnosed cases of depression.

# Deployment

The application is deployed using Flask, allowing seamless interaction between the user interface and the machine learning models.

# Usage

**User Input**: Users complete the questionnaire detailing their current mental and physical state.

**Prediction**: Based on the input, the system predicts the severity of depression.

**Outcome**: Users receive their classification and are encouraged to seek professional help if necessary.
